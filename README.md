# AutoML-Strategies

This repository contains AutoML strategies for Multi-label Classification problems using multi-objective optimization and surrogate models. It includes the projects:
* **Datasets**: the folder includes the datasets partitioned into 3-fold.
* **Random**: implementation of Random Algorithm.
* **EMANUEL (gEnetic Multi-objective strategy for the Automatic selectioN of mUlti-labEl cLassifiers)**: implementation of AutoML strategy.
* **EMANUEL_SM (gEnetic Multi-objective strategy for the Automatic selectioN of mUlti-labEl cLassifiers with Surrogate Models)**: implementation of AutoML strategy based in surrogate models. We did not add the surrogate models to this project due to GitHsb's upload size limitation.
* **SurrogateModel**: contains implementations for creating the meta-datasets from the metrics files; and obtaining the surrogate models from the meta-datasets.
