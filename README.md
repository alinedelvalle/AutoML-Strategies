# AutoML-Strategies

This repository contains AutoML strategies for Multi-label Classification problems using multi-objective optimization and surrogate models. It includes the folders:
* **Datasets**: the folder includes the datasets partitioned into 3-fold.
* **Random**: implementation of Random Algorithm.
* **AutoMLS**: implementation of AutoML strategy.
* **AutoMLS_SM**: implementation of AutoML strategy based in surrogate models. We did not add the surrogate models to this project due to GitHsb's upload size limitation.
